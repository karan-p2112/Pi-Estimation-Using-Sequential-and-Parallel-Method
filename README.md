# Pi-Estimation-Using-Sequential-and-Parallel-Method


The presented project introduces a Monte Carlo simulation focused on estimating the value of pi. The simulation's algorithm was implemented in both sequential and parallel programming environments. This involved leveraging OpenMP and CUDA to parallelize the computational process.  

Comprehensive performance evaluations were conducted to assess and compare the effectiveness of the different implementations. The parallel implementations exhibited remarkable speed enhancements in contrast to the sequential version. Notably, among the parallel approaches, the CUDA implementation demonstrated the highest level of speed.  

These findings underscore the efficacy of parallel computing in significantly expediting computational tasks. Moreover, the project emphasizes the critical importance of selecting the most suitable parallel programming environment to achieve optimal performance.
